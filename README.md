# Gravity Simulation
Welcome to Gravity Simulation Tool! This tool makes use of real-world physics equations of gravity, force and motion to simulate how celestial objects move and interact with each other. Enjoy messing around with different settings and configurations and challenge yourself to create intriguing orbits while avoiding collisions or planets shooting off into the distance.

## The Math Under The Hood
The backbone of this application is the **Equation of Gravitational Force** from **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**.
### F = GMm/RÂ²
With it, the tool can calculate the force acting upon each object and then convert **force** into **acceleration** using **Newton's Second Law of Motion**.
### F = ma
This allows the tool to calculate the relative position of each object at any given time. Since **Newton's Laws of Motion** also dictate that **acceleration = (change of velocity)/time** and **velocity = position/time**.
